Hello Teacher,

This is my project for the midterm of the class SE4458. Due to time and work limitations (I also was studying for the final project), I could not finish the project. In its current state, you can get/post/delete entities. However, there is no pagination, authorization, and the main tasks. However, it works with cloud storage, its REST controllers have api versioning, I tried to implement my api with dtos. 
It is my first time developing a web api in visual studio/c#. What I learned from it makes it very convenient to those that knows the syntax and how it works. The problem was that I was new, so I spent some time for researching and learning my way around.
I tried to deploy the project to azure, due to some complications, I ran into many troubles. However you should be able to enter the web application by https://universitytuitionpaymentwebapi.azurewebsites.net/swagger
